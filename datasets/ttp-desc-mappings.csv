"t1055.011"	"adversaries may inject malicious code into process via extra window memory ewm in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. ewm injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. 

before creating a window, graphical windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data.citation: microsoft window classes registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of ewm to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class. this ewm is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface api functions to set and get its value. citation: microsoft getwindowlong function citation: microsoft setwindowlong function

although small, the ewm is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure. malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in ewm, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s ewm.

execution granted through ewm injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored api calls such as writeprocessmemory and createremotethread.citation: elastic process injection july 2017 more sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention dep by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.  citation: malwaretech power loader aug 2013 citation: welivesecurity gapz and redyms mar 2013

running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. execution via ewm injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "
"t1053.005"	"adversaries may abuse the windows task scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. there are multiple ways to access the task scheduler in windows. the schtasks utility can be run directly on the command line, or the task scheduler can be opened through the gui within the administrator tools section of the control panel. in some cases, adversaries have used a .net wrapper for the windows task scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.

the deprecated at utility could also be abused by adversaries ex: at, though at.exe can not access tasks created with schtasks or the control panel.

an adversary may use windows task scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. the windows task scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote execution as part of lateral movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account such as system. similar to system binary proxy execution, adversaries have also abused the windows task scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.citation: proofpoint serpent

adversaries may also create ""hidden"" scheduled tasks i.e. hide artifacts that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. specifically, an adversary may hide a task from `schtasks /query` and the task scheduler by deleting the associated security descriptor sd registry value where deletion of this value must be completed using system permissions.citation: sigmahqcitation: tarrask scheduled task adversaries may also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata e.g., `index` value within associated registry keys.citation: defending against scheduled task attacks in windows environments "
"t1205.002"	"adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. with elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. the filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface or every interface if not specified. when the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

to establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with protocol tunneling.citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoorscitation: leonardo turla penquin may 2020

filters can be installed on any unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on windows hosts using `winpcap`.  adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `so_attach_filter` options. since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low cpu overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage."
"t1066"	"if a malicious tool is detected and quarantined or otherwise curtailed, an adversary may be able to determine why the malicious tool was detected the indicator, modify the tool by removing the indicator, and use the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.

a good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software. an adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may use software packing or otherwise modify the file so it has a different signature, and then re-use the malware."
"t1560.001"	"adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration. many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.

"t1156"	"adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. user shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. for example, when a user opens a command line interface or remotely logs in such as ssh a login shell is initiated. the login shell executes scripts from the system /etc and the user’s home directory ~/ to configure the environment. all login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. these configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. when the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately. 

adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. using bash as an example, the default shell for most gnu/linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d files citation: intezer-kaiji-malware. these files require root permissions and are executed each time any shell on a system launches. for user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile rocke which are sourced when a user opens a command line interface or connects remotely. adversaries often use ~/.bash_profile since the system only executes the first file that exists in the listed order. adversaries have also leveraged the ~/.bashrc file tsunami, rocke, linux rabbit, magento which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command line interface. some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution cannon, adversaries can use the ~/.bash_logout file to execute malicious commands at the end of a sessionpearl_shellbot. 

for macos, the functionality of this technique is similar but leverages zsh, the default shell for macos 10.15+. when the terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell. the login shell configures the system environment using /etc/profile, /etc/zshenv, /etc/zprofile, and /etc/zlogin. the login shell then configures the user environment with ~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin. the interactive shell uses the ~/.zshrc to configure the user environment. upon exiting, /etc/zlogout and ~/.zlogout are executed. for legacy programs, macos executes /etc/bashrc on startup."

"t1067"	"a bootkit is a malware variant that modifies the boot sectors of a hard drive, including the master boot record mbr and volume boot record vbr. citation: mtrends 2016

adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system, which may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.

### master boot record
the mbr is the section of disk that is first loaded after completing hardware initialization by the bios. it is the location of the boot loader. an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to adversary code. citation: lau 2011

### volume boot record
the mbr passes control of the boot process to the vbr. similar to the case of mbr, an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite the vbr to divert execution during startup to adversary code."
"t1037"	"adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence. initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. these scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.  

adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. 

an adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges."
"t1557"	"adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle aitm technique to support follow-on behaviors such as network sniffing or transmitted data manipulation. by abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic e.g. arp, dns, llmnr, etc., adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.citation: rapid7 mitm basics

for example, adversaries may manipulate victim dns settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.citation: ttint_ratcitation: dns_changer_trojanscitation: ad_blocker_with_miner adversaries may also manipulate dns and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials and session cookies.citation: volexity_0day_sophos_fw downgrade attacks can also be used to establish an aitm position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol ssl/tls or encryption algorithm.citation: mitm_tls_downgrade_attcitation: taxonomy_downgrade_att_tlscitation: tlseminar_downgrade_att

"t1033"	"adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system. they may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using os credential dumping. the information may be collected in a number of different ways using other discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs. adversaries may use the information from system owner/user discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

various utilities and commands may acquire this information, including whoami. in macos and linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with w and who. on macos the dscl . list /users | grep -v '_' command can also be used to enumerate user accounts. environment variables, such as %username% and $user, may also be used to access this information."

adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. if the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event e.g., system bootup then this technique can also be used for persistence.

### services

manipulation of windows service binaries is one variation of this technique. adversaries may replace a legitimate service executable with their own executable to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under local/domain account, system, localservice, or networkservice. once the service is started, either directly by the user if appropriate access is available or through some other means, such as a system restart if the service starts on bootup, the replaced executable will run instead of the original service executable.

### executable installers

another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. during the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %temp% directory to unpack binaries such as dlls, exes, or other payloads. when installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. this behavior is related to and may take advantage of dll search order hijacking. some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. this behavior is related to bypass user account control. several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors. citation: mozilla firefox installer dll hijack citation: seclists kanthak 7zip installer"

adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to llmnr udp 5355/nbt-ns udp 137 traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. if the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and ntlmv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. the adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through network sniffing and crack the hashes offline through brute force to obtain the plaintext passwords. in some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the ntlmv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. the relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it. citation: byt3bl33d3r ntlm relayingcitation: secure ideas smb relay

different ways to achieve this exist, including tcp state-exhaustion attacks such as syn floods and ack floods.citation: arbor annualdosreport jan 2018 with syn floods, excessive amounts of syn packets are sent, but the 3-way tcp handshake is never completed. because each os has a maximum number of concurrent tcp connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for tcp connections, thus preventing access to any tcp service provided by the server.citation: cloudflare synflood

ack floods leverage the stateful nature of the tcp protocol. a flood of ack packets are sent to the target. this forces the os to search its state table for a related tcp connection that has already been established. because the ack packets are for connections that do not exist, the os will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. when it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ack packets. this greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.citation: corero syn-ackflood"

within linux and macos systems, sudo sometimes referred to as ""superuser do"" allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. the sudo command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users or groups of users the ability to run some or all commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.""citation: sudo man page 2018 since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a timestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before it will re-prompt for a password. this is because sudo has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. sudo creates or touches a file at /var/db/sudo with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. additionally, there is a tty_tickets variable that treats each new tty terminal session in isolation. this means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty you will have to type the password again.

the sudoers file, /etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. this also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. this provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. however, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 all=all nopasswd: all.citation: osx.dok malware elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.

adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. for example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range. if it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. additional, if tty_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.

in the wild, malware has disabled tty_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \\'defaults !tty_tickets\\' >> /etc/sudoers.citation: cybereason osx proton in order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued killall terminal. as of macos sierra, the sudoers file has tty_tickets enabled by default."

1. checks extended attribute – gatekeeper checks for the quarantine flag, then provides an alert prompt to the user to allow or deny execution.citation: oceanlotus for os xcitation: 20 macos common tools and techniques

2. checks system policies - gatekeeper checks the system security policy, allowing execution of apps downloaded from either just the app store or the app store and identified developers.

4. notarization - using the `api.apple-cloudkit.com` api, gatekeeper reaches out to apple servers to verify or pull down the notarization ticket and ensure the ticket is not revoked. users can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an “unauthorized app” and the security policy will be modified.

adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within gatekeeper checks through logic errors e.g. exploitation for defense evasion, unchecked file types, and external libraries. for example, prior to macos 13 ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications in order to bypass gatekeeper security checks.citation: theevilbit gatekeeper bypass 2021citation: application bundle manipulation brandon dalton

"t1558"	"adversaries may attempt to subvert kerberos authentication by stealing or forging kerberos tickets to enable pass the ticket. kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern windows domain environments. in kerberos environments, referred to as “realms”, there are three basic participants: client, service, and key distribution center kdc.citation: adsecurity kerberos ring decoder clients request access to a service and through the exchange of kerberos tickets, originating from kdc, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. the kdc is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.  adversaries may attempt to abuse kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.

on windows, the built-in klist utility can be used to list and analyze cached kerberos tickets.citation: microsoft klist

linux systems on active directory domains store kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the ""ccache"". the credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.citation: mit ccache on modern redhat enterprise linux systems, and derivative distributions, the system security services daemon sssd handles kerberos tickets. by default sssd maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb as well as the corresponding key located in /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey. both files require root access to read. if an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for pass the ticket. the ccache file may also be converted into a windows format using tools such as kekeo.citation: linux kerberos ticketscitation: brining mimikatz to unixcitation: kekeo


kerberos tickets on macos are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to linux. by default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the kcm daemon process via the mach rpc protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access. the storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the krb5ccname environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the kcm daemon. users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in binaries or via apple's native kerberos framework. adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the kerberos framework to call lower-level apis for extracting the user's tgt or service tickets.citation: spectorops bifrost kerberos macos 2019citation: macos kerberos framework mit

within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program or more specifically, the import address table and the windows os. when a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database .sdb. if so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the os.

adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic values.

the observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. one means, originally implemented by cd00r citation: hartrell cd00r 2002, is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.

on network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable network device authentication for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more open or closed ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address ip on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.citation: cisco synful knock evolutioncitation: mandiant - synful knockcitation: cisco blog legacy device attacks  to enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage patch system image due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.

* active directory federation services ad fs, in which a trust relationship is established between active directory and azure ad 

ad fs can also be used with other saas and cloud platforms such as aws and gcp, which will hand off the authentication process to ad fs and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity and privileges. 

by modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities, an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud resources. for example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running a pta agent may inject a malicious dll into the `azureadconnectauthenticationagentservice` process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to azure ad, as well as records user credentials.citation: azure ad connect for read teamerscitation: aadinternals azure ad on-prem to cloud in environments using ad fs, an adversary may edit the `microsoft.identityserver.servicehost` configuration file to load a malicious dll that generates authentication tokens for any user with any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined ad fs policies.citation: magicweb

in some cases, adversaries may be able to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud. for example, adversaries who compromise a global administrator account in an azure ad tenant may be able to register a new pta agent via the web console, similarly allowing them to harvest credentials and log into the azure ad environment as any user.citation: mandiant azure ad backdoors"

dhcp is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a dhcp server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.citation: rfc2131 the typical server-client interaction is as follows:

2. the server responds with an `offer` message, which includes an available network address. 

3. the client broadcasts a `request` message, which includes the network address offered. 

4. the server acknowledges with an `ack` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.

adversaries may spoof as a rogue dhcp server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. for example, malware can act as a dhcp server and provide adversary-owned dns servers to the victimized computers.citation: new_rogue_dhcp_serv_malwarecitation: w32.tidserv.g through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the aitm position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.

adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to llmnr udp 5355/nbt-ns udp 137 traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. if the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and ntlmv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. the adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through network sniffing and crack the hashes offline through brute force to obtain the plaintext passwords.

in some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the ntlmv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. the relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.citation: byt3bl33d3r ntlm relayingcitation: secure ideas smb relay additionally, adversaries may encapsulate the ntlmv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as ldap, smb, mssql and http, to expand and use multiple services with the valid ntlm response.

although deprecated, the txf application programming interface api is still enabled as of windows 10. citation: blackhat process doppelgänging dec 2017

adversaries may abuse txf to a perform a file-less variation of process injection. similar to process hollowing, process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection. process doppelgänging's use of txf also avoids the use of highly-monitored api functions such as ntunmapviewofsection, virtualprotectex, and setthreadcontext. citation: blackhat process doppelgänging dec 2017

process doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps citation: blackhat process doppelgänging dec 2017:

* transact – create a txf transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code. these changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
* load – create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
* rollback – undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system.
* animate – create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.

"t1574.005"	"adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. these processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. if the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. if the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include system.

another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. during the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %temp% directory to unpack binaries such as dlls, exes, or other payloads. when installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. this behavior is related to and may take advantage of dll search order hijacking.

adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. this behavior is related to bypass user account control. several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.citation: mozilla_sec_adv_2012  citation: executable installers are vulnerable if the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event e.g., system bootup then this technique can also be used for persistence."

### search order hijacking
search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which windows searches for programs that are not given a path. the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. citation: microsoft createprocess citation: hill nt shell citation: microsoft winexec however, it is common for windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the windows system directory. an adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.

for example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument net user. an adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the windows system utility net. in addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then cmd.exe /c net user will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under pathext. citation: msdn environment property

authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently. cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. after the cookie is obtained through steal web session cookie, the adversary then imports the cookie into a browser they control and is able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active. once logged into the site, an adversary can access sensitive information, read email, or perform actions that the victim account has permissions to perform.

installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system. adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over https to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.citation: operation emmental

an endpoint dos denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. these layers include the operating systems os, server applications such as web servers, dns servers, databases, and the typically web-based applications that sit on top of them. attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. a dos attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed dos ddos.

to perform dos attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including ip address spoofing and botnets.

adversaries may use the original ip address of an attacking system, or spoof the source ip address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. this can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.

botnets are commonly used to conduct ddos attacks against networks and services. large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. in some of the worst cases for ddos, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. in such circumstances, distinguishing ddos traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile ddos attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major us banks.citation: usnyag iranianbotnet march 2016

in cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network such as high traffic gateway routers where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. this type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client http traffic was modified to include a reference to javascript that generated the ddos code to overwhelm target web servers.citation: arstechnica great firewall of china

to change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators. this may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as tftp, ftp, scp, or a console connection.  the original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image.

to change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods. in the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system.  this method typically requires administrative level access to the device.

in the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader. the boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system.  adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the rommonkit method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.  this malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime.

by modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before. examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via weaken encryption, authentication, via network device authentication, and perimeter defenses, via network boundary bridging.  adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include keylogging, multi-hop proxy, and port knocking.

adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.   when this method is used in conjunction with downgrade system image, one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.  by patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade. 

when the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage typically a form of flash memory, which is non-volatile or via tftp boot. 

when the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.  however, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with rommonkit to achieve persistence. "

* a legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as javascript, iframes, and cross-site scripting.
* malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.
* built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content.

often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. this kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. there are several known examples of this occurring.citation: shadowserver strategic web compromise

typical drive-by compromise process:

1. a user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
2. scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. 
    * the user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
3. upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.
4. if exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.
    * in some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.

unlike exploit public-facing application, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. this will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a dmz.

to perform network dos attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including ip address spoofing, and botnets.

adversaries may use the original ip address of an attacking system, or spoof the source ip address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. this can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.

oauth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. these frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.citation: okta
